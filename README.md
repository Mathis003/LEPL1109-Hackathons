# Hackathons : Stats - Data_Science

## Description

Welcome to the project repository for the LEPL1109 course at UCLouvain, part of the Civil Engineering program. This repository encompasses the source code for three engaging hackathons, each delving into different aspects of statistical analysis and data science. The first hackathon explores statistics, the second focuses on classifications, and the final one delves into clustering.

## Project Details

- **Language:** C.
- **Environment:** Linux.

### Hackathon #1
- **Grade:** 16.5/22.5.
- **Feedback:**
  1. **Explanation of Gamma Parameters - Not Satisfactory (2.1):** Clarification needed on the Gamma parameters.
  2. **Equality of Variances Missing (2.2):** The requirement for equality of variances is not fulfilled.
  3. **Incorrect Regression (3.1):** The regression is incorrect; the task was to explain production in relation to the years.
  4. **Comments + Analysis (3.2):** Additional comments and analysis needed. Consider including insights on R2, F-test, and T-test.

### Hackathon #2
- **Grade:** 23.7/28.

### Hackathon #3
- **Grade:** 16/18.
